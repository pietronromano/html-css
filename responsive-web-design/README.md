## Building the 'rwd.education' site

You can browse the source files used to build the [rwd.education](https://rwd.education) website here.

To build the site I used [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) to speed development.

**Note** a little TypeScript was used for the little bit of JavaScript used on site.

I also used the rather lovely [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to make all the favicon images/manifests.

If you are curious and 'don't mind getting your hands dirty', included in the folder should be everything you need to run it up in a local server yourself.

-   You will need to install a recent version of Node (I used 16 if memory serves)
-   You will need to install [Vite](https://vite.dev)
-   Run <code>[sudo] npm install</code> in Terminal from the 'rwd.education' folder
-   Assuming all installs OK (cross all your digits!), after everything is installed, you should now be able to run `npm run dev` from the Terminal and away you go.

Problems? Open an issue, Tweet at me, or send me a mail. Happy building!

  <summary><h2>Get to know the author</h2></summary>

_Ben Frain_ has been a web designer/developer since 1996. He is currently employed as a lead product designer at Bet365. Before the web, he worked as an underrated (and modest) TV actor and technology journalist, having graduated from Salford University with a degree in media and performance. He has written four equally underrated (his opinion) screenplays and still harbors an, admittedly fading, belief he might sell one.</br>
He likes to pretend he isn’t a nerd but spends an inordinate amount of time building keyboards and talking about them, text editors, and the web on his blog and YouTube channel. Outside of geekery, he enjoys managing his youngest son’s football team, if standing in a freezing wet field, while a team of 11-year-olds shout at you to shut up can be called enjoyment. He is also hoping that, one day soon, his eldest teenage son will emerge from his room to spend some time with him and his wife, rather than merely to ask whether there is anything to eat or to ask for money.
