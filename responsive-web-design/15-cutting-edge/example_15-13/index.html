                    The successor to the Ergodox, the Moonlander enjoys a unique
                    thumb cluster and wonderfully slim chassis. It even has a
                    little peizo speaker that chirps when in powers on. Best of
                    all, foldaway and detachable palm rests.

                    Unlike anything else you will have used, arguably better
                    described as an 'input device' than a keyboard, the
                    Svalboard lightly is an evolution of the Datahand, itself an
                    entirely unique design. Magnetic switches, and an entirely
                    bespoke fit means while it won't be for everyone, for some
                    it can be a career saver.
